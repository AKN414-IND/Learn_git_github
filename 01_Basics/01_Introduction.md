# Introduction to Git and GitHub

Welcome to the first module of the Git and GitHub Learning series! In this module, we will cover the basics of what Git and GitHub are and how they are used in software development.

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. It provides a web-based graphical interface and features like access control, bug tracking, task management, and more.

In the next section, we will guide you through setting up Git and GitHub on your machine.
