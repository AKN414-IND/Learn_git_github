# Branching in Git

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

## Creating and Switching Branches
- To create a new branch: `git branch <branch-name>`
- To switch to the branch: `git checkout <branch-name>`

It's good practice to create a new branch for each new feature or issue.

Up next, merging branches.
