# Cloning a Repository

Cloning a repository means making a copy of a repository hosted on GitHub to your local machine. This allows you to work on the project locally.

## Steps to Clone a Repository
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click the "Code" button.
3. Copy the URL shown under "Clone with HTTPS".
4. Open your terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied.
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.
