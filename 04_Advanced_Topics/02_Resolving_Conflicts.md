# Resolving Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts happen when the same parts of the code are changed in different branches.

## How to Resolve Conflicts
- Git will mark the file as conflicted.
- Manually edit the file to resolve the differences.
- After resolving, commit the changes.

Conflict resolution is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the code.

Coming up next, using GitHub Issues.
